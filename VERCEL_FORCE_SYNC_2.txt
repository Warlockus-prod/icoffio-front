URGENT VERCEL SYNC ISSUE
======================

GitHub has latest commit: becbc8d
- Fixed GraphQL endpoint undefined error  
- Added proper error handling
- Should resolve digest 3742252848

But Vercel still shows old buildId: FKKS2N-tGLwmeH-X8-7c-

This file forces new deployment to sync GitHub with Vercel.

Expected: New buildId, working site, no 500 errors

Timestamp: $(date)
Emergency fix priority: CRITICAL
